## Description

This is a note taker application that allows a user to create, read, and delete notes. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work in the back-end by building a web server. Given the front-end code, my duty was to build a server that would connect both the front-end and the back-end of the project. This project also features the use of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Project Deployed on [Heroku](https://young-harbor-17190.herokuapp.com/)

From here, the usage of this project is to let a user keep track of notes and to create new notes. There is also a feature to delete notes once the note is no longer needed.
